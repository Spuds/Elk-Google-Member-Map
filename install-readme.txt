This installs a member map to your website which allows your members to pin their location on a map. It uses the Google Map 3.0 API to generate the map and place "Push" pins.

Google Earth can also make use of the pin data. This addon allows for the exporting of all user pin data in to a .kml file for those that want to use Google Earth to see their member locations.  Simply add a network link in Google Earth to point at https://www.example.com/forums/index.php?action=GoogleMap;sa=kml to get the data for Google Earth.  The capability to export .kml files is controlled by the permission to view the map, and keep in mind Google Earth will appear as a guest on your forum.

In your admin panel you will need to enable it, which implies your acceptance of Google Maps terms of service.  Choose the settings that best work for your site.  There are many settings so you can fine tune the experience for your users and site.  Next, your members will need to edit their profiles and place a pin on the map to show their location and save their profile. That pin will then display on the main member map page. The admin will also need to set the map permissions so users can view the map as well as place a pin on the map.
