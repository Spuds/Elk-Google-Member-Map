Thank you for trying this ElkArte addon.

If you leave the "Remove all data associated with this addon" [b]unchecked[/b] then there are a couple of things that will be left alone.

	1) Any permissions you may have set for the addon
	2) The member table modification which is all the pins your members have placed. These are left to allow you to reinstall/upgrade and not loose any data.

If you instead check that option, then all member data associated with this addon will also be removed
