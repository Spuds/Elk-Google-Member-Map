### Introduction

This ElkArte addon installs a member map to your website which allows your members to pin their location on a map. It uses Google Maps V3 API to generate the map and place "Push" pins.  You are required to [Get an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) from Google.  Once you obtain your key, you then must enable both "map" and "places" API's for the addon to fully function.

Simply install this package through the package manager located in your Administration Panel. Manual edits may be required if your site uses a custom theme. This addon is compatible with Elkarte 1.0 & 1.1

In your admin panel you will need to enable it and set any customization you like. Next, your members will need to edit their profiles and place a pin on the map to show their location and save their profile. That pin will then display on the main member map page. The admin will also need to set the map permissions so users can see and use it.

### Features
 - Adds a member map button to the main menu under the community dropdown
 - Adds a member profile area for users to add their pin to their profile.  This will then appear on the map.
 - Ability to search by location when placing their pin
 - Adds Profile info bubbles to the map pins
 - Ability to cluster pins together to improve map legibility.  Clusters will expand out as you zoom in on them
